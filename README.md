# Gas Utility Service Management System

## Overview
This Django application addresses the challenges faced by a gas utility company in managing high volumes of customer service requests. The application allows:

- **Customers** to submit service requests, track their status, and view account information.
- **Customer support representatives** to manage requests and provide efficient support.

Key technologies used include:
- **Django** for backend development.
- **PostgreSQL** for database management.
- **Redis** for asynchronous task queuing.
- **Celery** for handling background jobs.
- **WSL** for running Celery and Redis on Windows.

The system effectively manages high customer volumes using asynchronous processing, ensuring reduced wait times and improved service quality.

## Features
1. **Service Request Submission**: Customers can submit detailed service requests with file attachments.
2. **Request Tracking**: Customers can monitor the status of their requests in real time.
3. **Support Management Tool**: Customer support representatives can view and update service requests(using django builtin tool called django-administration).
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: High-volume updates are handled efficiently using Celery and Redis.

## How the High Volume Issue is Solved
To handle a high number of customer requests:
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Celery offloads heavy tasks like notifications and updates to a background queue managed by Redis.
- **Efficient Database Design**: PostgreSQL ensures quick and reliable data storage and retrieval.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (for Celery)
- WSL (for running Celery and Redis on Windows)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kimforee/gas_utility
   cd gas_utility
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For Linux/WSL:
     ```bash
     pip install -r linux_requirements.txt
     ```

4. Configure the `.env` file with your database and Redis credentials ( please find the .env template for the setup ):
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key (to be found inside the django application)
   DEBUG=True
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database
   CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://hostname:port/0
   ```

5. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Run Redis on WSL after installation:
   ```bash
   sudo service redis-server start
   ```

8. Start Celery workers:
   ```bash
   celery -A gas_utility worker --loglevel=info
   ```

9. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
